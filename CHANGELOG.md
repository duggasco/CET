# Changelog

## [Latest] - V2 Charts Trend Lines Restored (2025-08-01)

### üé® Feature Restoration
- **Added min/max/average trend lines to v2 charts**: Restored the dashed trend lines from v1 implementation
- **Visual design matches v1**: Thin dashed lines for average (gray), maximum (blue), and minimum (red)
- **Smart tooltip filtering**: Tooltips only show main balance line, not trend lines

### üîß Technical Implementation
- **static/js/charts-v2.js Updates**:
  - Added three additional datasets to chart data for avg/max/min trend lines
  - Trend lines use `borderDash: [5, 5]` for dashed appearance
  - Very thin borders (0.5px) with no hover interaction (`pointRadius: 0`)
  - Colors: Gray (rgba(107,114,128,0.95)), Blue (rgba(59,130,246,0.95)), Red (rgba(239,68,68,0.95))
  - Order property ensures trend lines render behind main data
  - Updated tooltip filter to exclude trend line datasets
  - Fixed clearCharts() method to handle multiple datasets

### ‚úÖ Result
- Both 90-day and 3-year charts now display horizontal dashed trend lines
- Statistics continue to show in chart headers (Max/Avg/Min values)
- Charts maintain all existing functionality (click to filter by date, etc.)
- Visual parity with v1 implementation achieved

## [Previous] - V2 Multi-Selection Table Persistence Bug Fixed (2025-08-01)

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix
- **Fixed v2 multi-selection breaking Tableau-like behavior**: Tables now correctly show all items with selections highlighted
- **Root cause**: `loadFilteredData()` only set `selection_source` for single-table selections, causing all tables to show filtered data
- **Solution**: Implemented parallel API calls for multi-table selections to maintain proper source table behavior

### üîß Technical Implementation
- **static/js/app.js Updates**:
  - Added `appendSelectionSource()` helper function for proper URL parameter construction
  - Modified `loadFilteredData()` to make parallel API calls when multiple tables have selections
  - First call gets intersection data for charts/KPIs
  - Additional calls get "all items" data for each table with selections using `selection_source`
  - Uses `Promise.allSettled()` for robust error handling
  - Smart data combination: Tables with selections use their "all items" data, others use intersection

### ‚úÖ Testing Results
- Multi-selection (2 clients + 1 fund) correctly shows all 10 clients and all 6 funds
- All permutations of table selections tested and working
- Tableau-like behavior fully restored
- No regressions in single-table selections
- Error handling verified with graceful fallback
- Performance maintained with parallel execution

### üìä Example
- Select: Capital Management + Growth Ventures (clients) + Prime Money Market (fund)
- Result: Client table shows ALL 10 clients (2 highlighted), Fund table shows ALL 6 funds (1 highlighted)
- Account table shows only intersection (5 accounts)
- Total AUM shows $21.8M (intersection amount)

## [Previous] - V2 Charts Updated to Match V1 Functionality (2025-08-01)

### üé® Enhancement
- **V2 charts now have identical functionality to V1 charts**: All visual features, statistics, and interactions match exactly
- **Added chart statistics display**: Max/Avg/Min values now shown above both 90-day and 3-year charts
- **Fixed data field compatibility**: Charts handle both v1 (`total_balance`) and v2 (`balance`) response formats
- **Matched exact v1 styling**: Border width (2.5px), point hover effects, grid appearance, and animations

### üîß Technical Changes
- **static/js/charts-v2.js Updates**:
  - Added statistics calculation and display using `#recentChartStats` and `#longTermChartStats` elements
  - Updated `updateChart()` to support both data field formats (total_balance/balance, balance_date/date)
  - Applied v1 chart styling: borderWidth 2.5, pointRadius 0, hover effects with white border
  - Uses v1 date formatters (`formatDate()` and `formatDateLong()`) for consistent display
  - Improved chart click handling by storing original data for accurate date extraction
  - Added animation settings: 750ms duration with easeInOutQuart easing
  - Hide legend and configure grid to match v1 appearance

### ‚úÖ Testing Results
- Chart statistics update correctly with all filter types
- Visual appearance identical between v1 and v2
- Chart click functionality works for date filtering
- Multi-selection updates charts with correct aggregated data
- Both API response formats handled seamlessly

### üìä Example
- 90-day chart shows: "Max: $106.3M | Avg: $104.2M | Min: $102.1M"
- Charts display with same blue (#0085ff) and green (#00d647) color scheme
- Hover shows formatted balance tooltips
- Click functionality filters tables to selected date

## [Previous] - Balance Tables Sorted by Total Balance (2025-08-01)

### üêõ Bug Fix
- **Fixed balance tables sorting alphabetically instead of by balance**: All tables now display data from largest to smallest total balance
- **Root cause**: Both DashboardService and CacheRepository were using alphabetical sorting (ORDER BY name/id)
- **Solution**: Updated all SQL queries to use ORDER BY total_balance DESC (or balance DESC for accounts)

### üîß Technical Changes
- **services/dashboard_service.py Updates**:
  - Changed client queries from `ORDER BY cb.client_name` to `ORDER BY cb.total_balance DESC`
  - Changed fund queries from `ORDER BY cb.fund_name` to `ORDER BY cb.total_balance DESC`
  - Changed account queries from `ORDER BY cb.account_id` to `ORDER BY cb.balance DESC`
  - Updated both regular and paginated query methods
  - Maintained secondary sort key for paginated queries (e.g., ORDER BY cb.total_balance DESC, cb.client_id)

- **repositories/cache_repository.py Updates**:
  - Updated `get_cached_client_balances()` to sort by total_balance DESC
  - Updated `get_cached_fund_balances()` to sort by total_balance DESC
  - Updated `get_cached_account_details()` to sort by balance DESC
  - Ensures cached data maintains same sort order as fresh queries

### ‚úÖ Testing Results
- Overview page shows largest clients/funds/accounts first
- Sorting maintained across all filter combinations
- Multi-selection preserves sort order
- Text filters show filtered results sorted by balance
- Both cached and fresh data properly sorted
- Docker deployment verified with correct sorting

### üìä Example
Before: Acme Corporation (alphabetically first) shown at top with $25.5M
After: Tech Innovations LLC (largest balance) shown at top with $26.8M

## [Previous] - Multi-Selection Tableau-like Behavior Restored (2025-08-01)

### üêõ Bug Fix
- **Fixed multi-selection behavior broken by v2 API changes**: When selecting a single client, all clients now remain visible with the selected one highlighted
- **Root cause**: `loadClientData()` was using filtered data from v2 API which only returned the selected client
- **Solution**: Added additional API call to fetch all clients when using v2 API for single selection

### üîß Technical Changes
- **app.js loadClientData() Enhancement**:
  - Added call to `/api/v2/dashboard?selection_source=client` to get all clients
  - Preserves Tableau-like behavior where source table shows all items with selections highlighted
  - Maintains filtered data for funds and accounts tables
  - Only makes additional call when v2 API is enabled

### ‚úÖ Testing Results
- Single client selection shows all 10 clients with selected one highlighted
- Fund and account tables properly show filtered data for selected client
- Multi-selection behavior works correctly
- Performance remains good with minimal overhead from additional API call

## [Previous] - Charts Fixed for All Selection States (2025-08-01)

### üêõ Bug Fix
- **Fixed charts showing blank in overview and single-client states**: Charts now display properly in all selection states, not just multi-client
- **Root cause**: `loadOverviewData()` and `loadClientData()` were using v1 API endpoints directly instead of checking for v2 flag
- **Solution**: Updated both functions to use v2 API when `useV2DashboardApi` flag is set

### üîß Technical Changes
- **app.js Updates**:
  - Modified `loadOverviewData()` to check for v2 flag and use `/api/v2/dashboard` when enabled
  - Modified `loadClientData()` to check for v2 flag and use v2 API with client filter
  - Both functions now properly extract chart data from `data.charts` structure when using v2
  - Added fallback to v1 API if v2 request fails
  - Consistent chart data handling across all selection states

### ‚úÖ Testing Results
- Charts display correctly in overview (all clients/funds)
- Charts display correctly for single client selection
- Charts display correctly for multi-client selection
- All chart interactions (click to filter by date) working properly

## [Previous] - Docker v2 Deployment Issues Fixed (2025-08-01)

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed "Invalid Date" in charts**: Charts now properly display dates when v2 features are enabled in Docker
- **Fixed KPI reversion on multi-selection**: KPIs now correctly show filtered totals instead of reverting to full AUM
- **Fixed TypeError in KPI calculations**: Added safety checks for undefined values in `.toFixed()` calls

### üîß Technical Changes
- **run.sh Enhancement**:
  - Added missing `useV2DashboardApi` flag to Docker environment
  - Full flag set: `{"useV2Tables":true,"useV2Charts":true,"useV2DashboardApi":true}`
  - Ensures all v2 features work properly in Docker deployments

- **app.js Safety Improvements**:
  - Added null/undefined/NaN checks before `.toFixed()` calls (lines 415, 422)
  - Prevents TypeError when KPI data is missing or malformed
  - Defaults to '0.0' for invalid values

- **v2-api.js Chart Data Fix**:
  - Already fixed `transformToV1Format` to extract chart data from `v2Data.charts`
  - Ensures chart data is properly passed to chart components

### ‚úÖ Testing Results
- Docker deployment now works correctly with all v2 features enabled
- Charts display proper date labels instead of "Invalid Date"
- KPIs show correct filtered values for multi-selections
- No console errors when selecting multiple clients
- Performance maintained with v2 API optimizations

## [Latest] - Docker Deployment Updated with V2 Tables Enabled (2025-08-01)

### üöÄ Deployment Update
- **Modified run.sh**: Added FEATURE_FLAGS environment variable to enable v2 tables and charts by default in Docker deployments
- **Rationale**: The KPI/Chart reversion bug fix is implemented in v2 tables, but Docker was running with v1 by default
- **Change**: Added `-e 'FEATURE_FLAGS={"useV2Tables":true,"useV2Charts":true}'` to docker run command
- **Impact**: All Docker deployments now benefit from the double API call fix and improved performance

## KPI/Chart Reversion Bug Fix: Double API Calls Eliminated (2025-08-01)

### üêõ Bug Fix
- **Fixed critical issue**: KPIs and charts no longer revert to full AUM after showing correct filtered values
- **Root cause**: Double API calls occurring when v2 tables enabled - tableManager making redundant API calls
- **Solution**: Modified tables-v2.js to accept pre-fetched data and bypass tableManager abstraction

### üîß Technical Changes
- **tables-v2.js Enhancement**:
  - Modified `updateTables()` to accept either data object or params
  - Checks for data properties (client_balances, fund_balances, account_details)
  - Uses provided data directly without making API calls
  - Maintains backward compatibility with param-based calls
  - Only updates tables that have data (prevents clearing with undefined)

- **app.js Refactoring**:
  - Replaced all `tableManager.updateXTable()` calls with direct `await tablesV2.updateTables(data)`
  - Updated functions: loadOverviewData, loadFilteredData, loadClientData, loadFundData, loadAccountData, loadAccountDataForFund, loadClientFundData
  - Maintained restoreSelectionVisuals() and updateDownloadButton() calls
  - Eliminated dependency on tableManager for v2 tables (since v1 is deprecated)

### ‚úÖ Testing Results
- API Behavior Test: Shows correct filtered KPI values without reversion
- Comprehensive Function Tests: All loadXData functions working correctly
- Double API Call Test: No double calls detected - single API request per action
- Performance: Improved due to elimination of redundant API calls
- No regressions: All existing functionality preserved

### üìö Key Design Decisions
- Direct calls to tablesV2 since v1 endpoints are deprecated
- No backward compatibility needed as v1 is being phased out
- Always update all tables for consistency
- Separation of concerns: tables-v2 handles only table updates

### üìù Documentation
- Updated BUGS.md: Marked "KPI/Chart Values Revert to Full AUM" as RESOLVED
- Updated TODO.md: All Priority 0 implementation tasks marked complete
- Created test scripts: test_double_api_call.py, test_all_functions.py, test_api_behavior.py

## [Previous] - Multi-Selection Bug Fix: Tableau-like Behavior Restored (2025-08-01)

### üêõ Bug Fix
- **Fixed critical regression**: Tables now show ALL items when 2+ items are selected, with selected items highlighted
- **Root cause**: Frontend was using v1 API endpoint (`/api/data`) instead of v2 (`/api/v2/dashboard`) for multi-selections
- **Solution**: Updated `loadFilteredData()` to use v2 API which supports the `selection_source` parameter

### üîß Technical Changes
- **Backend (v2 API)**:
  - Added `selection_source` parameter to `/api/v2/dashboard` endpoint
  - Updated `DashboardService` to conditionally exclude filters based on selection source
  - Modified `_build_full_where_clause()` to accept `exclude_source` parameter
  - All table methods now respect selection source for Tableau-like behavior

- **Frontend**:
  - Updated `loadFilteredData()` to use v2 API endpoint instead of v1
  - Added compatibility handling for v2 API response format (nested charts structure)
  - Calculate `selectionSource` when only one table has selections
  - Pass `selection_source` through entire API call chain (app.js ‚Üí apiWrapper ‚Üí v2Api)

### ‚úÖ Testing Results
- Single client selection: Shows all 10 clients with selected one highlighted
- Multi-client selection: Shows all 10 clients (not just the 2 selected)
- Cross-table filtering: Other tables filter correctly based on selections
- KPI metrics: Update appropriately based on filtered context
- Performance: No regression, responses remain <200ms

### üìù Documentation
- Updated BUGS.md: Marked "Table Multi-Selection Limiting Bug" as RESOLVED
- Updated PLAN.md: Phase 2.5 marked as COMPLETED
- Updated TODO.md: All Priority 0 tasks marked as complete

- All three tables show consistent QTD/YTD values for intersection data
- Example: Capital Management + Corporate Bond Fund shows +0.2% QTD, +2.0% YTD across all tables

## [Previous] - QTD/YTD Metrics Alignment Fix

### Fixed
- **QTD/YTD metrics misalignment across tables during multi-selection**
  - All tables now show identical QTD/YTD percentages when filtering by client + fund combinations
  - Root cause: Different tables calculated metrics from different data subsets instead of unified intersection
  - Solution: Modified all queries to use `full_where_clause` for QTD/YTD calculations while maintaining display logic

### Added
- **Helper function for consistent QTD/YTD calculations**
  - `generate_qtd_ytd_cte_sql()` function eliminates code duplication across client/fund/account queries
